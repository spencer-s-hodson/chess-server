TODO
- go back through these classes and put Users, AuthTokens and Games where needed
- understand what headers mean in these tables
- is it ok if the DELETE services don't include requests since they have no body?
- obviously the javadoc comments
- difference between Game[] and HashSet<Game>. Like, what is better here?
